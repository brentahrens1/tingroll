        title: <h1>Grand Country</h1>,
        showBody: <p>my grandmother was born in Shanghai in 1939<br /> in chinese, her name means “grand country.”<br /> she was given a name meant for a boy,<br /> because in chinese, “country” is masculine —<br /> i am familiar with the way man can mean space,<br /> boy can mean borders,<br /> how a body marked by its grandeur is often just another way of saying<br /> that gender is not something to be shared freely,<br /> or transgressed easily.<br /><br /> the binary in chinese is not so unlike a great wall,<br /> a rigid, fortified structure meant to keep a kind of person in<br /> and another kind out but that, in the end, never managed to do either —<br /> and instead, stood as a testament to what it looks like to separate two things,<br /> i cannot help but wonder sometimes —<br /> if my Abu knew being a woman wasn’t about being contained<br /> would she be proud of her name,<br /> the way that i am learning to be proud of my own, or<br /> the way that i am just now learning what it means to unlearn that great wall, brick by brick<br /> and reclaiming what it means to belong to your own country.<br /><br /> my Abu tells me one afternoon,<br /> “i’m a girl, but i’ve always felt like a boy,<br /> just like you.”<br /> in that moment, we are the same age,<br /> just old enough to know that being a woman is an answer we are too young to question our bodies into<br /> becoming,<br /> we are just learning not to un-peel our fear if it is not ripe yet<br /> and<br /> we have the same face,<br /> round like a moon that always hides half of herself away.<br /> i want to tell her about the conversations i’ve been having about gender,<br /> tell her that sometimes dysphoria<br /> feels a lot like diaspora, like that “grand country” she knows so well is a place i’m still trying to reach<br /> but perhaps she already knows this,<br /> and perhaps there are no words for me to describe it anyways,<br /> because what is gender if not a question swallowing another question whole?<br /> a younger generation asking what an older one could not?<br /> what is the future if not a homecoming to your past?<br /> sometimes,<br /> i’ve found,<br /> the best way to build tomorrow is to return to it.<br /><br /> when my grandma is describing the man who brings her strawberries on the weekend,<br /> she often says,<br /> “she brought me strawberries”<br /> when talking about her girl dog, she says,<br /> “he is so loyalty, he is such a good boy.”<br /> in chinese, the words for “he” and “she” sound exactly the same.<br /> upon hearing tā, you would have no way of knowing a person’s gender<br /> which is often why my grandma gets the pronouns mixed up in english.<br /> she often tells stories about people she meets,<br /> switching and careening and dissolving “he” from “she” like the swish of a fan,<br /> she does not think much of it these days.<br /> sometimes, she catches herself and says a different pronoun,<br /> but her tone stays the same—<br /> i want to believe in her mind that the person does too.<br /> when my grandma says “tā,”<br /> what i think she means is<br /> “i was once afraid to be whole too”<br /> or<br /> “these words are houses with leaky roofs”<br /> or<br /> “i still believe i could belong to myself”<br /> so,<br /> when my mother corrects my grandmother<br /> for “misgendering” people on accident,<br /> i can’t help but smile because<br /> maybe in her mind there is a future where these pronouns fail to encompass who we are too, and<br /> i want to believe i can live in that version of tomorrow too,<br /> so<br /> i don’t think my grandma is getting anything wrong about gender,<br /> i think she is telling us exactly how we’ve always wanted to be so,<br /> meet me there.<br /> there is a version of my future that looks exactly like my grandmother’s past<br /> and in that future, there is no way of knowing my gender when you hear me either<br /> i am a walking tā<br /> like a guiltless bird<br /> i am every bit the place my grandma’s name built her up to be<br /> and every misspoken gender still waiting to greet me<br /> i am not imagining a future beyond gender,<br /> i am embodying it.<br /> and there is no grander country than that.</p>,
