They are the co-editor and co-founder of Loves Me | Loves Me Not, a yearly Valentineâ€™s Day zine featuring work entirely by queer, trans, non-binary, and women artists of color. Their work explores feelings of belonging, possibility, gender, hope, and how queerness & gender non-conformity can act as guides or maps for understanding spaciousness both within & outside of our bodies. Their work has been featured in Netflix, BuzzFeed, ATTN:, Banana Magazine, Slant'd, and NAVEL to name a few. At their yolky core, they believe that we are all fundamentally deserving of abundance, love, complex futures, transformation, non-binary curiosity, pleasure, fresh lychee, and gender euphoria.</p>
